# bootstrap-resp

In this project my aim was to build a main "about me" page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. 

I started with the "about me" page, and once I was happy with the main layout used the CSS as a skeleton for the other two pages as well. 

The portfolio page was tricky for me at first, as I was not using the rows and columns as bootstrap properly. Once that was sorted out, it was a lot better. 

On the Contact page, I used Font-Awesome to add some social media links, and they are functional. For the contact form that I used, I attempted to attach a php document, but it does not function. My instructor said that was beyond the expectations of the assignment.

All other links are functional, and the NAVBAR and FOOTER are consistent accross all pages. I am happy with the responsiveness for all pages, although there are certain intermediary screen sizes where the footer on the "about me" page does not remain sticky as it should.
